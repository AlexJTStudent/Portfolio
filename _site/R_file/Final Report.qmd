# Semester Project

Author Alex Tovar

# Introduction

I will be working with WECC's weather data from Data Science Society, to keep building insights for the company and because I'm familiarized with the data.

# Define the Problem

**What is the population of your research?** WECC wants us to investigate if there are any relationships between precipitation and humidity.

**What do you think is the nature of the relationship you hope to discover?** The more Humidity is present, the more precipitation tends to be present.

**What type of data are you looking for (quantitative? categorical?)** both quantitative

**What type of analysis are you expecting to do (t-test, regression? ANOVA? Chi-square test for independence? etc.):** linear regression

**What is the response/dependent variable?** Precipitation

**What is the explanatory variable** Humidity

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(rio)
library(car)
library(downloader)
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}
data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Alex\\Documents\\GitHub\\WECC\\2000-2020-rexburg.csv")

data <- data %>%
  rename(Temperature_f = Temperature..F.,
         Precipitation_in = Precipitation..inches.,
         Pressure_mb = Pressure..mb.,
         Wind_Speed = Wind.Speed..mph.)
```

```{r}
math_lm <- lm(Precipitation_in ~ Humidity, data = data)
plot(Precipitation_in ~ Humidity, data = data)
abline(math_lm)
```

# Describe the Data

```{r}
chart1 <- ggplot(data, mapping = aes(x = Humidity, y = Precipitation_in)) + 
geom_point() +
labs(title = "Humidity & Precipitation Trends",
       y = "Precipitation (Inches)") +
theme_solarized() 
chart1 + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

**Does the relationship look linear?** Not Really, the relatioship looks very weak and with lots of variation at the end.

# Analyze the Data

### Requirements:

```{r}
qqPlot(math_lm$residuals)
```

```{r}
plot(math_lm, which = 1)
```

**What is the correlation coefficient, r?** 0.3468858

```{r}
cor(Precipitation_in ~ Humidity, data = data)
```

**What does this r show?**

There is an weak positive relationship between humidity and Precipitation.

## Fit a Linear Regression Model

```{r}
lm_output <- lm(data$Precipitation_in ~ data$Humidity)
```

HO: B1 = 0 There is no linear relationship between humidity and precipitation

HA: B1 != 0 There is linear relationship between humidity and precipitation

```{r}
summary(lm_output)
```

**What is your p-value?** less than 2e-16

**What is the confidence interval for the slope?**

```{r}
confint(lm_output, level = 0.95)
```

**Interpret the confidence interval:** I have 95% confidence that the true population slope lies within (0.00792 and 0.00897)

**What is your conclusion?** Although the p-value is less than alpha, suggesting a statistically significant relationship, the requirements of linear regression (such as linearity and normally distributed residuals) are not met. Therefore, the result may not be reliable, and we must write a report to WECC that the data is unreliable to make valid inferences and answers to conclude a relationship between Humidity and Precipitation.
